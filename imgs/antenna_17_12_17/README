A dipole antenna was used to increase the power of the module because
the module alone could not boadcast over a large enough range (it 
could only consistently communicate about 1 cm away)

Since power of a signal increases with the square of antenna
length, we get that the antenna needs to be ((5 m)/(1cm))^0.5
times longer. The antenna native to the module is approximately
3 cm long, giving a final antenna length of ~78 cm. I made
each branch that long for testing purposes.
